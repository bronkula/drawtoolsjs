# DrawToolsjs
Canvas library for javascript. I will almost certainly write something in depth here. For now, there's a file. It's got some functions. Most of them should be relatively clear how to use.

## A note on Draw Tools
Many of the actual drawing tools in this library, as opposed to the positional tools, Use the same methodology for arguments. A context to be applied, some values necessary for the particular shape, and then an options object. This object should be all the relevant context options for drawing, such as colors and line widths.
